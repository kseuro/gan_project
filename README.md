# gan_project
Generative adversarial networks applied to high energy particle simulation.

### gan_basics
Basic implementation of a GAN using MNIST dataset. This small project is meant to be a proof of concept, as well as act as the first building block in the research project.

### dcgan 
Implementation of deep convolutional GAN framework. Architecture, initializations and training parameters taken from: Radford, Goodfellow, et al [arXiv: 1511.06434v2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434v2.pdf) and [arXiv: 1606.03498v1 Improved Techniques for Trainings GANs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03498.pdf) 

#### TODO:

Phase 1: Perform proof-of-concept of DCGAN performance using MNIST dataset (complete)

Phase 2: Modify functioning DCGAN to work with LArCV MCC8/9 data.

Phase 3: Convert functioning DCGAN to WGAN-GP model.
