# gan_project
Generative adversarial networks applied to high energy particle simulation.

### gan_basics
Basic implementation of a GAN using MNIST dataset. This small project is meant to be a proof of concept, as well as act as the first building block in the research project.

### dcgan (under construction)
Implementation of deep convolutional GAN framework. 

#### TODO:

Phase 1: Perform proof-of-concept of DCGAN using MNSIT dataset.

Phase 2: Modify functioning DCGAN to accept particle gun data as input.

Phase 3: Convert functioning DCGAN to WGAN-GP model using particle gun data.
